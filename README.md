编译命令如下:
-
1. 首先装好 Ubuntu 64bit，推荐  Ubuntu  18 LTS x64

2. 命令行输入 `sudo apt-get update` ，然后输入
`
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential asciidoc binutils bzip2 curl gawk gettext git libncurses5-dev libz-dev patch python3.5 python2.7 unzip zlib1g-dev lib32gcc1 libc6-dev-i386 subversion flex uglifyjs git-core gcc-multilib p7zip p7zip-full msmtp libssl-dev texinfo libglib2.0-dev xmlto qemu-utils upx libelf-dev autoconf automake libtool autopoint device-tree-compiler g++-multilib antlr3 gperf
`

3. `git clone -b main --single-branch https://github.com/Lienol/openwrt openwrt` 命令下载好源代码，然后 `cd openwrt` 进入目录

4. ```bash
   ./scripts/feeds clean
   ./scripts/feeds update -a
   ./scripts/feeds install -a
   make menuconfig
   ```

5. `make -j8 download V=s` 下载dl库（国内请尽量全局科学上网）


6. 输入 `make -j1 V=s` （-j1 后面是线程数。第一次编译推荐用单线程）即可开始编译你要的固件了。

6. 编译完成后输出路径：openwrt/bin/targets

你可以自由使用，但源码编译二次发布请注明我的 GitHub 仓库链接。谢谢合作！

OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead
of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully
writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the
application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you
to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.
For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having
to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for
full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.

Sunshine!

## Development

To build your own firmware you need a GNU/Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack of a
case sensitive file system.

### Requirements

You need the following tools to compile OpenWrt, the package names vary between
distributions. A complete list with distribution specific packages is found in
the [Build System Setup](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem)
documentation.

```
gcc binutils bzip2 flex python3 perl make find grep diff unzip gawk getopt
subversion libz-dev libc-dev
```

### Quickstart

1. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain all the latest package definitions
   defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run `./scripts/feeds install -a` to install symlinks for all obtained
   packages into package/feeds/

3. Run `make menuconfig` to select your preferred configuration for the
   toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run `make` to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build the
   cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the GNU/Linux kernel & all chosen
   applications for your target system.

### Related Repositories

The main repository uses multiple sub-repositories to manage packages of
different categories. All packages are installed via the OpenWrt package
manager called `opkg`. If you're looking to develop the web interface or port
packages to OpenWrt, please find the fitting repository below.

* [LuCI Web Interface](https://github.com/openwrt/luci): Modern and modular
  interface to control the device via a web browser.

* [OpenWrt Packages](https://github.com/openwrt/packages): Community repository
  of ported packages.

* [OpenWrt Routing](https://github.com/openwrt-routing/packages): Packages
  specifically focused on (mesh) routing.
