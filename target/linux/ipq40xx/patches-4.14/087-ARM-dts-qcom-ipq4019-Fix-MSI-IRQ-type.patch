Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: qcom: ipq4019: Fix MSI IRQ type
Date: Thu, 24 Jan 2019 14:00:47 +0100

The databook clearly states that the MSI IRQ (msi_ctrl_int) is a level
triggered interrupt.

The msi_ctrl_int will be high for as long as any MSI status bit is set,
thus the IRQ type should be set to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, causing the
IRQ handler to keep getting called, as long as any MSI status bit is set.

A git grep shows that ipq4019 is the only SoC using snps,dw-pcie that has
configured this IRQ incorrectly.

Not having the correct IRQ type defined will cause us to lose interrupts,
which in turn causes timeouts in the PCIe endpoint drivers.
