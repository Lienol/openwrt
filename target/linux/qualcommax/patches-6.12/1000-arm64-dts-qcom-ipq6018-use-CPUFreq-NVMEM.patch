Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq6018: use CPUFreq NVMEM

IPQ6018 comes in multiple SKU-s and some of them dont support all of the
OPP-s that are current set, so lets utilize CPUFreq NVMEM to allow only
supported OPP-s based on the SoC dynamically.

As an example, IPQ6018 is generaly rated at 1.8GHz but some silicon only
goes up to 1.5GHz and is marked as such via an eFuse.
