Subject: platform/x86: pmc_atom: Match all Lex BayTrail boards with
 critclk_systems DMI table

The critclk_systems[] DMI match table already contains 2 Lex BayTrail
boards and patches were just submitted to add 3 more entries for the
following models: 3I380NX, 3I380A, 3I380CW.

Looking at: https://www.lex.com.tw/products/embedded-ipc-board/
we can see that Lex BayTrail makes many embedded boards with
multiple ethernet boards and none of their products are battery
powered so we don't need to worry (too much) about power consumption
when suspended.

Add a new DMI match which simply matches all Lex BayTrail boards and drop
the 2 existing board specific quirks.
