Subject: mtd: spi-nor: add mx25l25635f with SECT_4K

This patch fixes an issue with the creation of the
ubi volume on the AVM FRITZ!Box 4040. The mx25l25635f
and mx25l25635e support SECT_4K which will set the
erase size to 4K. This is used by ubi to calculate
VID header offsets. Without this, uboot and linux
disagrees about the layout and refuse to attach
the ubi volume created by the other.
