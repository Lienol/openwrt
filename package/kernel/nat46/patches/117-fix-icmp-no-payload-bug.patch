nat46: Fix for ICMP error packets with no payload.

This patch is propagated from the kernel 4.4 commit
d8b29a8e31f948a5d7338aa69c36e0f654fcb9e4

When no payload is attached to the original packet, any
ICMP error message generated in response to such packets
gets dropped due to malformed packet at CE.

During the translation of packet-in-error in ICMP,
the IPv6 header in ICMPv6 payload gets corrupted.
Hence, the translated packet gets dropped at CE.

This fix updates the outer IPv4 header's total length
before translating to IPv6 header.
