Subject: [PATCH] wireless-regdb: Update regulatory rules for Russia (RU)

Russian entry is incorrect. According to the last regulations
document of Feb 29, 2016, 160 MHz channels and 802.11ad are allowed.

Note that there was never a DFS requirement in Russia, but always was
NO-OUTDOOR on 5GHz.
Maximum power is 200mW that is ~23dBm on all 5GHz channels.
Also Russia has never been regulated by ETSI.

EIRP has been reduced by 4dBm because of TPC requirement.
